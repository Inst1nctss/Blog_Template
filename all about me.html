    <p> <font color="lightgreen"> <b>Welcome to My Short Introduction</b> </font> </p>
    <p> <font color="lightgreen"> <b>My name is Hans Christian Louis M. Magtoto.</b> </font> 
    <font color="lightgreen">My height is 6'2. I'm currently 19 years old, living in Baguio City.</p> </font>
    <p> <font color="lightgreen">My greatest interest is technology, which never ceases to fascinate and inspire me. 
            It's a world I never get tired of exploring, especially when combined with my love of playing video games. 
            For me, life is a never-ending exploration of new things, and my desire to learn never goes away.</p> </font> 
    <p> <font color="lightgreen">My two favorite simple pleasures in life are indulging in mouthwatering food and immersing 
            myself in the online worlds of video games. These indulgent moments give me a special sense of fulfillment and joy.</p> </font> 
    <p> <font color="lightgreen">I enjoy a wide variety of interests that I engage in during my free time. 
            I can express myself creatively through music whenI play the guitar, and I can compete and 
            unwind when I play video games. Nothing makes me happier than spending quality time
            with my family and friends developing relationships and creating memories.</p> </font> 
    <p> <font color="lightgreen">I am blessed to have skills that make my life better. My skill at
            video games, my talent for strumming guitar chords, and my talent for making art in 
            my spare time all add to my sense of accomplishment and self-fulfillment.</p> </font> 
    <p> <font color="lightgreen">Although my path is still ongoing, one significant accomplishment is that I have finished high school.
            It serves as evidence of my dedication to both academic success and personal development, laying the foundation for 
            the numerous accomplishments I intend to achieve in the future.</p> </font>
